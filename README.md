### _a C# console application for a bakery that takes a bread and pastry order and returns the cost._

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET 5.0
- dotnet

## Description
The first C# project at Epicodus. The project should create a bakery console application with C# and properly use custom classes, name spaces, and auto-implemented properties.

_The application should include the following functionality:_

- _There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry._
- _When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry._
- _A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like._
- _The application will return the total cost of the order._

Pierre offers the following deals:
- _Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10._
- _Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10._
- _All functionality for the models should be tested._
